# MLOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Azure subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

   - The Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

   - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

2. Azure DevOps subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure DevOps account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

   > **Note**: You will need privileges to create projects on the DevOps account. Also, you need privileges to create Service Principal in the tenet. This translates to **Ensure that the user has 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' permissions on the Subscription**.

3. Azure Machine Learning service workspace. An Azure Machine Learning workspace is a foundational resource in the cloud that you use to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models. It ties your Azure subscription and resource group to an easily consumed object in the service.

4. Azure Machine Learning compute instance. The compute instance is created during Exercise 1 from the hands-on lab. It used as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud to run the quickstart integrated notebooks uploaded in your workspace file share.

## Before the hands-on lab

6. Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.

   - **Resource group**: Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use **MCW-MLOps**.

   - **Workspace name**: Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. In this example, we use **quick-start-ws**. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others.

   - **Location**: Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.

   - **Container registry**: Use an existing container registry in your subscription or enter a name to create a new container registry. For example, you can use **quickstartwsregistry**.

   ![The Machine Learning Create form is displayed populated with the aforementioned values. The Review + Create button is highlighted.](media/bhol-02a.png 'Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace page')

7. After you are finished configuring the workspace, select **Review + Create**. Select **Create** after you review the fields you just entered.

    > **Note**: It can take several minutes to create your workspace in the cloud.

    When the process is finished, a deployment success message appears.

8. To view the new workspace, select **Go to resource**.

9. Navigate to the [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://ml.azure.com) and select the workspace that you created or select **Launch now** under **Try the new Azure Machine Learning studio** in the **Overview** section of your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

### Task 5: Setup Azure DevOps Agent

In order to complete the lab, you need an DevOps agent to run your build and release pipeline jobs. You have two options for the types of agents you can use to run your pipeline jobs:

1. Microsoft-hosted agents
2. Self-hosted agents

**Option 1: Configure Microsoft-hosted agents**

Microsoft has temporarily disabled the free grant of parallel jobs running on Microsoft-hosted agents for public projects and for certain private projects. If you do not already have an approved free grant for parallel jobs, you can request the grant by submitting a request [here](https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request). **Please note that it takes about 2-3 business days to respond to your free grant requests**. The other option is to configure and pay for parallel jobs as per instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs?view=azure-devops&tabs=ms-hosted).

**Option 2: Setup and configure self-hosted agents**

For this option, we will look at steps to setup and configure a self-hosted agent that can be used to run your pipeline jobs.

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](http://dev.azure.com).

2. Select **User setting, Personal Access Tokens**.

    ![Azure DevOps home page is shown with the user setting menu open and the Personal Access Tokens option selected.](media/setup-pat1.png 'Personal Access Tokens')
